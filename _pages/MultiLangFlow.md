## Problem



## Solution
After collecting the language selection, use string concatenation and variable file names in all play message and menu nodes allowing you to reuse the same flow for more than on language.

### Constraints
You will need to use a naming convention for your message files like chooseDept_en.wav, chooseDept_es.wav, chooseDept_fr.wav.  

## Required Components
- prerecorded messages with the same prefix names for their function followed by an underscore language abbreviation, and no spaces 
- pebble templates
